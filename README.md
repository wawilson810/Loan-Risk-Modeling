# Loan-Risk-Modeling

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that reads in a [dataset on loans](https://github.com/wawilson810/supervised-learning-challenge/blob/main/Resources/lending_data.csv) and performs a Logistic Regression and a Random Forest Classification on it to create a model for classifying high risk loans.
