# Loan-Risk-Modeling

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that creates supervised machine learning models fitted to a [dataset of loans.](https://github.com/wawilson810/supervised-learning-challenge/blob/main/Resources/lending_data.csv) The machine learning models will be trained to identify which records are 'high risk' using this set of records which have already been labelled as 'high risk' or not. These models can then be used to label new records if the accuracy is satisfactory. The two models that we used are a Logistic Regression and a Random Forest Classifier. Initially, I predicted that the Logistic Regression would be the more accurate model since we are dealing with a binary output. This prediction did hold true but the difference was not very substantial with the testing score of the Logistic Regression being 0.9937 and the Random Forest being 0.9917 which means the Logistic Regression model was only 0.2% more accurate.
